    <h2 id="taj">1.Taj Mahal, Agra</h2>
    <p>
      Known as one of the seven wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal in Agra
      stands as a living testimony of the eternal love between Mughal Emperor
      Shah Jahan and Queen Mumtaz. Construction of the Taj Mahal started in
      1632, and a visit to this UNESCO World Heritage Site will demonstrate why
      it took this iconic monument so long to complete. The ethereal beauty of
      this white marble tombstone remains unparalleled to this day. While the
      Taj Mahal exudes stories of romance, it is also a showcase of the glory of
      Mughal architecture.

    <h2 id="Red Fort">2.Red Fort, Delhi</h2>
    <p>
      It would be an understatement to not include Red Fort in our list of
      historical places in India. The Red Fort was commissioned for construction
      in 1638, during the time when Shah Jahan shifted his capital from Agra to
      Delhi and is a perfect display of the supremacy of Mughal craftsmanship.
      The aesthetic appeal together with the historical significance makes Red
      Fort one of the most visited forts in India. This colossal monument in the
      present time is also the site where the honourable Prime Minister of India
      delivers a speech on Independence Day.

      Ajanta and Ellora Caves, the twin caves considered as one of the largest
      rock-cut temple complexes in the world, are a must-see attraction for both
      history enthusiasts and creative souls. Located in the heart of
      Maharashtra, the Ajanta and Ellora Caves are a perfect display of the
      Jataka tales and Buddha's life. Apart from Buddhism, the site is also of
      great importance for the followers of Hinduism and Jainism. There is a
      fascinating fact about Ajanta and Ellora caves: a British officer, John
      Smith accidentally discovered them while he was hunting tigers.

    <p>
      One of the iconic landmarks in India that was built to serve as an access
      point for the entry and exit of Britishers, the Gateway of India is
      incredibly significant. The Gateway of India after its completion in 1924
      was inaugurated by the then Viceroy, the Earl of Reading. In addition to
      its importance in the British context, the Gateway of India has now
      evolved as a popular tourist attraction in Mumbai and remains jam packed
      with people throughout the year.

    <p>
      An incredible testimony of the Indo-Islamic architecture, Qutub Minar is a
      UNESCO’s World Heritage Site in Delhi. Qutub Minar soars to a height of
      240 ft and is said to get its name after the first Muslim ruler of North
      India, Qutb-ud-din-Aibak. Featuring a magnificent red sandstone minaret
      and inscriptions in Parso-Arabic, one can learn about its history by
      reading these inscriptions. It is also one of the tallest individual
      towers in the world and has weathered many natural disasters. So, while
      you are in the capital city of India, make sure to visit Qutub Minar for a

    <h2 id="Hawa">6.Hawa Mahal, Jaipur</h2>
    <p>
      Fondly known as the “palace of winds”, Hawa Mahal in Jaipur has its own
      interesting story to tell. The Hawa Mahal, in the shape of a crown, was
      designed by Lal Chand Ustad for Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh's queens to
      get a glimpse of the outside world, something that was not possible under
      the purdah system. This unique palace is structured like a honeycomb with
      as many as 953 intricate windows. As the palace is located in the heart of
      Jaipur, it is easily accessible from other parts of the city.

    <p>
      Victoria Memorial is one of the most popular tourist attractions located
      in the erstwhile capital of India, Kolkata. Built during the peak of
      British rule, the Victoria Memorial is dedicated to Queen Victoria. The
      lush-green expansive gardens and museum add immense aesthetic appeal to
      this white marble building that is spread over 64 acres of land.
      Apparently, Lord Curzon proposed the idea for the conception of the
      Victoria Memorial, and Sir William Emerson is the genius behind its
      intricate design.

    <h2 id="Khajuraho">8.Khajuraho Temple, Madhya Pradesh</h2>
    <p>
      Just like forts and palaces, there are numerous temples in India that tell
      fascinating tales from the past and one of them is the Khajuraho Temple.
      The Khajuraho Temple is home to innumerable sculptures that depict
      creativity and themes of love and beauty at their best. One can also find
      a perfect amalgamation of Jainism and Hinduism models here, which also, in
      turn, reflects the acceptance of diversity. For its unparalleled charm and
      significance, Khajuraho Temple has even been gracefully added to the list
      of UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites.
      <li><b>Nearest airport:</b>Khajuraho Airport</li>

    <h2 id="Mahabodhi">9.Mahabodhi Temple, Bodh Gaya</h2>
    <p>
      A revered site for all Buddhist followers, Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya
      is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The reason behind the increasing
      significance of the Mahabodhi Temple is that it is at this very site where
      Gautam Buddha attained enlightenment. The Mahabodhi Temple dates back to
      the times of emperor Ashoka and has a magnificent idol of Buddha that is
      about 5 ft. high. There are many legends that say that Mahabodhi Temple
      will be the last site to disappear whenever the world will come to an end.
      Interesting, right?

    <p>
      Jallianwala Bagh is an infamous historical site that preserves the
      sacrifices of all those who lost their lives during the Jallianwala Bagh
      Massacre. Hundreds of innocents were killed in the Jallianwala Bagh after
      General Dyer gave orders for a mass shooting. In order to honour these
      lost lives, the government of India built a memorial at this very site.

      a popular tourist attraction in Amritsar along with Golden Temple.
